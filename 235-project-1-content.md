# I. High Concept

  Much like common jigsaw puzzles but with straight-edged square tiles rather than ones with jagged teeth or holes. Also, since this is digital, the player can upload their own photos into the game.

# II. Genre
	
	This game is one-hundred percent a puzzler.

# III. Platform 

	This game’s platform is on desktop only. 

# IV. Mood 

  This game’s mood is all about what the player makes of it using built in-game tools. The player can go for a tense, hard experience by dividing their photo into many squares and including the timer mechanic or could go for a relaxing, easy one by setting the divisions lower and not including a timer. The narrative is built by one’s personal progress with the pieces and the premise of the game is to take a fractured, twisted photo and return it to its original state. 

# V. Esthetics

  The Esthetics of this game will involve nice calming hues for the backgrounds and buttons that are abstract and simplistic enough so that they will provide an appropriate backdrop to whatever picture is uploaded.
